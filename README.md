# Hello. I'm Turnerj

_aka. James Turner - a programmer and entrepreneur with a love of cars, music and technology_

I've created a lot of different projects over the years across a number of areas including:

- [Database interfaces like MongoFramework](https://github.com/TurnerSoftware/MongoFramework)
- [Web crawlers like Infinity Crawler](https://github.com/TurnerSoftware/InfinityCrawler)
- [Caching systems like Cache Tower](https://github.com/TurnerSoftware/CacheTower)
- [Extremely optimized text processing like Quickenshtein](https://github.com/Turnerj/Quickenshtein)
- [DDNS tools like DDNS4Me](https://github.com/TurnerSoftware/DDNS4Me)
- [Sitemap parsing tools](https://github.com/TurnerSoftware/SitemapTools)
- [Robots exclusion parsing tools](https://github.com/TurnerSoftware/RobotsExclusionTools)
- [Build versioning tools for .NET](https://github.com/TurnerSoftware/BuildVersioning/)

When I'm not creating and managing my own projects, I'm participating in a number of other projects including [Forem](https://github.com/forem/forem), [Schema.NET](https://github.com/RehanSaeed/Schema.NET), [MiniProfiler](https://github.com/MiniProfiler/dotnet) and [ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/).

I haven't scratched the surface of the projects I want to build or work on.
[Supporting me](https://github.com/sponsors/Turnerj) allows not only the work for these projects to continue, it also helps me to develop other new and interesting projects.
